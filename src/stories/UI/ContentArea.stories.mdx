# Content Area

<Source
  language="tsx"
  code={dedent`
    import { ContentArea } from "@actionishope/shelley-cms";
  `}
/>

ContentArea is a simple container with a Focus-on container to lock the ContentArea in a focus-lock whilst FocusMode editing is on.

Designed to work within the EditorLayout it's height is probably the most noteworthy; it defines the height of the editor layout and will need to be adjusted from it's default height (80vh) which is for testing. For Editor layout it is set to `calc(100vh - var($headerHeight))` or something to that effect. On mobile things are a little tricky as `100vh` can mean different things on device as the addressbars pop in and out. The only real sure-fire way is to measure the `innerHeight` with JS and set a CSS variable equal to 1% of that instead.

```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  // First we get the viewport height and we multiple it by 1% to get a value for a vh unit
  const vh = window.innerHeight * 0.01;
  // Then we set the value in the --vh custom property to the root of the document
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--vh", `${vh}px`);

  // We listen to the resize event
  window.addEventListener("resize", () => {
    // We execute the same script as before
    const vh = window.innerHeight * 0.01;
    document.documentElement.style.setProperty("--vh", `${vh}px`);
  });
}, []);
```

Then in your CSS you can use `height: calc(var(--vh, 1vh) * 100 - 65px)`. Boom.

Back to ContentArea, there really isn't much to look at as I shall now demonstrate:

<Story
  name="a) ContentArea"
  parameters={{
    docs: {
      source: {
        code: dedent`
{/* Toggle enabled on and off with the setting of 'FocusMode' editing. Pass a shard containing the control itself so users can exit back into normal editing mode. */}
<ContentArea focusOnProps={{ enabled: false }}>
  <p>MetaDataEditor</p>
  <p>BlockEditors</p>
  </ContentArea>
);`,
      },
    },
  }}
>
  <ContentArea focusOnProps={{ enabled: false }}>
    <p>MetaDataEditor</p>
    <p>BlockEditors</p>
  </ContentArea>
</Story>

Check EditorLayout page for proper example in context.

<Source language="tsx" id="editor-contentarea--a-content-area" />

## Content

Takes any children but designed to work with BlockEditor, MetaDataEditor and any other compoent geared around content editing in a page context.

## TextField Props

<ArgsTable of={ContentArea} />

## Stying

Add some info...

<Source
  language="css"
  dark
  format={false}
  code={dedent`
    #docs {
      write-some: style-docs;
    }
  `}
/>
